# swiftWarGame

This is just a Small game, from a Swift Tutorial.

This is just an small example of Swift 2.2 and also, focusing on some Contraints applied to a Card Game. 
This can be viewed on iPhone and iPad, and can be tested in Portrait or Landscape.

I was learning the beauty of this, so, it's just a begginers stuff.

The Source of the tutorial is around [here](https://vimeo.com/117732132)
